I’ll be posting here much more infrequently than other places, and most of my discussion will be personal life lessons, business strategy/discussion and web development/coding.

Please bear with me while I get this new website set up. Please refer to my other sites in the meantime and check back here in the coming weeks/months while I start to write new musings on things not related to fitness or weight loss here.
